# Giphy
Endless Retro 80s!

- The theme of this Giphy page is, 1980s.

- The page will automatically generate 10 buttons, each has an 80s theme.

- When the user clicks on one of the ten buttons, gif's related to that button theme will appear, and an 80s soundtrack will start playing. 

- Once the gif's are generated, the gif will be "still" (no animation).

- When the user clicks on a gif, it will then generate "animation." If clicked, again, the gif will go back to the "still" state.

- There is a search bar ("Totally Radical Search") on the page. The user can input any search, and then click the submit button ("Like, Click Submit!) for their new search topic.

- The new search will create a new button, which will generate gif's related to that topic, and those gif's will also have 
   the "still" and "animate" functionality.
   
- A restriction rating will be displayed for the user above each gif for all buttons.
